# finsight-md
Finsight is an AI driven application that aims to simplify financial planning by offering personalized investment advice built for Bangkit Academy Batch 2 2024 Capstone Project. The app uses machine learning to analyze user-provided data, such as income, investment amount, and risk tolerance (moderate, aggressive, or safe), and recommends optimal allocations in stocks, money markets, mutual funds, and other investment options.

By leveraging historical stock data and financial ratios, the app predicts stock trends and tailors suggestions for users. It helps individuals with surplus funds make informed decisions, encouraging smarter financial habits and long-term wealth building. We also provide a social feature to help users engage with one another and gather insight on financial topics. With a cloud-based architecture, the app ensures scalability and reliability, while mobile compatibility provides ease of access for users.
